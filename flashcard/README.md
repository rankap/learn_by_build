# How to Build a Flashcard Quiz App in Python

In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to build a simple **Flashcard Quiz App** in Python. Flashcard apps are a great way to help with learning, and this project will help you practice essential Python concepts like lists, dictionaries, loops, and user input handling.

---

## What Weâ€™re Building

The Flashcard Quiz App will present a set of flashcards to the user, asking a question on each one. The user will type an answer, and the app will check if itâ€™s correct. At the end of the quiz, the app will provide the userâ€™s score.

### Key Python Concepts Covered:
- Lists and dictionaries
- Loops
- Functions
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- User input handling

---

## Step 1: **Setting Up the Flashcards**

Weâ€™ll use a **dictionary** to store our flashcards, where each key is a question, and each value is the correct answer. 

Hereâ€™s a simple set of flashcards:

```python
flashcards = {
    "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": "Jupiter",
    "Who wrote '1984'?": "George Orwell",
    "What is the chemical symbol for water?": "H2O",
    "Who painted the Mona Lisa?": "Leonardo da Vinci"
}
```

- **Why a dictionary?**: We use a dictionary because it allows us to easily store each question-answer pair.

---

## Step 2: **Building the Main Quiz Loop**

Weâ€™ll create a function to handle the main quiz loop, which will go through the flashcards one by one, ask the user the question, and check if their answer is correct.

Hereâ€™s the basic logic for the quiz:

```python
def quiz_user(flashcards):
    score = 0  # Initialize the score to 0
    total_questions = len(flashcards)  # Total number of questions

    for question, correct_answer in flashcards.items():
        user_answer = input(question + " ").strip()  # Ask the user the question
        if user_answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():  # Check if the answer is correct
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1  # Increment the score if the answer is correct
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is: {correct_answer}")
    
    return score, total_questions
```

### Breaking Down the Function:

1. **Score Tracking**:
   ```python
   score = 0
   ```
   - **Why?**: We initialize the score to 0 to track how many questions the user answers correctly.

2. **Loop Through Flashcards**:
   ```python
   for question, correct_answer in flashcards.items():
   ```
   - **Why?**: The loop goes through each question-answer pair in the `flashcards` dictionary. The `.items()` method allows us to get both the question and the correct answer in each iteration.

3. **Getting the Userâ€™s Answer**:
   ```python
   user_answer = input(question + " ").strip()
   ```
   - **Why?**: We use `input()` to ask the user each question. We also use `.strip()` to remove any extra spaces before or after their answer.

4. **Checking if the Answer is Correct**:
   ```python
   if user_answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():
   ```
   - **Why?**: We compare the userâ€™s answer to the correct answer, ignoring case sensitivity by using `.lower()`. If the answer is correct, we increment the score; otherwise, we show the correct answer.

5. **Returning the Results**:
   ```python
   return score, total_questions
   ```
   - **Why?**: After the loop, we return both the userâ€™s score and the total number of questions so that we can display their final results.

---

## Step 3: **Displaying the Final Score**

Once the quiz is complete, weâ€™ll show the user how many questions they got right and give them a percentage score.

Hereâ€™s the code for that:

```python
def display_score(score, total_questions):
    print(f"\nYou got {score} out of {total_questions} correct!")
    percentage = (score / total_questions) * 100
    print(f"Your score: {percentage:.2f}%")
```

### Breaking It Down:

1. **Displaying the Score**:
   ```python
   print(f"\nYou got {score} out of {total_questions} correct!")
   ```
   - **Why?**: This simply prints the userâ€™s raw score (how many questions they got right out of the total).

2. **Calculating the Percentage**:
   ```python
   percentage = (score / total_questions) * 100
   ```
   - **Why?**: This calculates the percentage of correct answers by dividing the score by the total number of questions and multiplying by 100.

---

## Step 4: **Putting It All Together**

Now, letâ€™s bring everything together into the main function and make the app run.

Hereâ€™s the full code for the Flashcard Quiz App:

```python
import random

flashcards = {
    "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
    "What is the largest planet in our solar system?": "Jupiter",
    "Who wrote '1984'?": "George Orwell",
    "What is the chemical symbol for water?": "H2O",
    "Who painted the Mona Lisa?": "Leonardo da Vinci"
}

def quiz_user(flashcards):
    score = 0
    total_questions = len(flashcards)

    for question, correct_answer in flashcards.items():
        user_answer = input(question + " ").strip()
        if user_answer.lower() == correct_answer.lower():
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is: {correct_answer}")
    
    return score, total_questions

def display_score(score, total_questions):
    print(f"\nYou got {score} out of {total_questions} correct!")
    percentage = (score / total_questions) * 100
    print(f"Your score: {percentage:.2f}%")

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Flashcard Quiz!")
    score, total_questions = quiz_user(flashcards)
    display_score(score, total_questions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### How It Works:

- The `main()` function starts by welcoming the user to the quiz.
- It then calls the `quiz_user()` function to handle the quiz itself and returns the score and total questions.
- Finally, it displays the userâ€™s score using `display_score()`.

---

## Step 5: **Additional Features (Optional)**

Now that the basic Flashcard Quiz App is complete, here are some ideas for enhancing it:

1. **Shuffle the Questions**:
   - Use `random.shuffle()` to randomize the order of the questions each time the user takes the quiz.
   ```python
   questions = list(flashcards.items())
   random.shuffle(questions)
   ```

2. **Add More Flashcards**:
   - You can add more flashcards to your dictionary to make the quiz longer and more challenging.

3. **Multiple-Choice Format**:
   - Instead of asking the user to type out answers, you could turn the game into a multiple-choice quiz, where they select from a list of options.

4. **Track High Scores**:
   - Keep track of the userâ€™s best scores across multiple games by saving their scores to a file or database.
