# Building a "LessPass" Clone in Python

In this tutorial, we will build a simplified version of a password manager similar to [LessPass](https://lesspass.com/), which generates deterministic passwords based on a master password and some user input. Our password manager will use user input like the site name, login username, and a master password to generate strong, unique passwords for different websites, all without storing the passwords.

## What You Will Learn:
- How to generate passwords using user input.
- How to use hashing with Python's `hashlib` module for secure password generation.
- How to salt your passwords to increase security.
- How to format your passwords with specific rules (length, special characters, etc.).

---

## Step 1: **Setting Up Your Environment**

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Create a new Python file named `lesspass_clone.py` to start the project.

---

## Step 2: **Import Required Modules**

We will be using the `hashlib` module to generate a secure hash from user inputs, and `string` and `random` modules to generate a password with specific characters.

```python
import hashlib
import string
import random
```

---

## Step 3: **Collect User Inputs**

The user needs to provide:
1. A **site name** (e.g., "example.com").
2. A **login username**.
3. A **master password** (this is the main password you remember to generate all others).

```python
def get_user_input():
    site = input("Enter the site name (e.g., example.com): ")
    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    master_password = input("Enter your master password: ")
    return site, username, master_password
```

---

## Step 4: **Generate a Hash from User Input**

We will combine the site name, username, and master password into a string, and use the `hashlib` module to create a secure hash. This hash will serve as the base for generating the password.

```python
def generate_hash(site, username, master_password):
    combined_string = f"{site}{username}{master_password}"
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256(combined_string.encode())  # Create SHA-256 hash
    return hash_object.hexdigest()  # Return the hash in hexadecimal format
```

### Explanation:
- We concatenate the `site`, `username`, and `master_password` into one string.
- The `hashlib.sha256()` function generates a SHA-256 hash (a secure cryptographic hash).
- The `hexdigest()` method returns the hash in a hexadecimal string format.

---

## Step 5: **Generate a Password from the Hash**

Now, we need to turn the hash into a strong password. We will do this by selecting a fixed number of characters from the hash and ensuring the password includes letters, digits, and special characters.

```python
def generate_password(hash_value, length=16):
    all_characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    random.seed(hash_value)  # Seed the random number generator with the hash

    password = ''.join(random.choice(all_characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password
```

### Explanation:
- We define a set of characters that includes:
  - `string.ascii_letters` (both lowercase and uppercase letters),
  - `string.digits` (numbers 0-9),
  - `string.punctuation` (special characters like `!@#%^&*()`).
- We use the `random.seed()` function with the hash value to make sure the password is deterministic. This ensures that every time the same input is provided, the same password will be generated.
- The `random.choice()` function is used to pick random characters from our character set, and we generate a password of a fixed length (default is 16 characters).

---

## Step 6: **Putting It All Together**

We will now combine everything into a main function that gathers user input, generates the hash, and creates the password.

```python
def main():
    print("Welcome to LessPass Clone!")

    site, username, master_password = get_user_input()

    # Generate the hash
    hash_value = generate_hash(site, username, master_password)
    print(f"Hash generated: {hash_value[:8]}...")

    # Generate a password
    password = generate_password(hash_value, length=16)
    print(f"Generated password: {password}")
```

---

## Step 7: **Running the Program**

Save the code in `lesspass_clone.py` and run the program:

```bash
python lesspass_clone.py
```

When you run the program, it will prompt you for the site, username, and master password. After providing the input, it will generate and display a secure password based on that input.

---

## Step 8: **Enhancements and Security Considerations**

### Salting:
You can improve the security of your password generator by adding a salt (random string) to your hash. This helps protect against precomputed attacks like rainbow table attacks. Here’s how you can add a salt:

```python
def generate_hash(site, username, master_password):
    salt = "random_salt_string"  # You could generate a more dynamic salt per user
    combined_string = f"{site}{username}{master_password}{salt}"
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256(combined_string.encode())  # Create SHA-256 hash
    return hash_object.hexdigest()  # Return the hash in hexadecimal format
```

### Password Strength:
You can modify the password length and include additional password rules (such as requiring at least one number and one special character).

## Full Code

Here’s the complete code for our `LessPass` clone:

```python
import hashlib
import string
import random

def get_user_input():
    site = input("Enter the site name (e.g., example.com): ")
    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    master_password = input("Enter your master password: ")
    return site, username, master_password

def generate_hash(site, username, master_password):
    combined_string = f"{site}{username}{master_password}"
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256(combined_string.encode())  # Create SHA-256 hash
    return hash_object.hexdigest()  # Return the hash in hexadecimal format

def generate_password(hash_value, length=16):
    all_characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    random.seed(hash_value)  # Seed the random number generator with the hash

    password = ''.join(random.choice(all_characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password

def main():
    print("Welcome to LessPass Clone!")

    site, username, master_password = get_user_input()

    # Generate the hash
    hash_value = generate_hash(site, username, master_password)
    print(f"Hash generated: {hash_value[:8]}...")

    # Generate a password
    password = generate_password(hash_value, length=16)
    print(f"Generated password: {password}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Conclusion

You've successfully built a basic password manager using Python! This project demonstrates how to use hashing for deterministic password generation, which is the core of how LessPass works. You can now enhance the project by adding security improvements, like salting or password complexity checks. Additionally, you could build a GUI for a more user-friendly experience. 

Happy coding!
