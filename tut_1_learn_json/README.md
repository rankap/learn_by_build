# Learn How to Use JSON as a Small Database for Your Python Projects by Building a Hotel Accounting System

Are you tired of setting up and managing bulky databases for your small projects? If youâ€™ve got a small-scale application and need something lightweight, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) can be your best buddy! In this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a simple Hotel Accounting System using Python, and weâ€™ll use JSON to store and manage our data.

But first, letâ€™s dive into the basics of JSON files, the standard format, and how to use Python's `json` module to manipulate these files.

### What is JSON?

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format thatâ€™s easy to read and write for humans, and easy to parse and generate for machines. Itâ€™s commonly used to transmit data between servers and web applications, and it's great for small databases!

#### Standard JSON Format

A JSON file stores data in key-value pairs, much like a Python dictionary. Hereâ€™s a basic structure:

```json
{
    "key": "value",
    "key2": {
        "nested_key": "nested_value"
    },
    "list_key": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

In our Hotel Accounting System, weâ€™ll use JSON to store information like bookings, customer details, and room charges.

### Python's `json` Module

Pythonâ€™s built-in `json` module makes it easy to read and write JSON data. Let's look at some key methods in this module:

#### `json.load()`

The `json.load()` method reads JSON data from a file and converts it into a Python object (usually a dictionary).

```python
import json

with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
```

#### `json.loads()`

The `json.loads()` method reads JSON data from a string and converts it into a Python object.

```python
json_string = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}'
data = json.loads(json_string)
```

#### `json.dump()`

The `json.dump()` method writes a Python object to a JSON file.

```python
data = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file)
```

#### `json.dumps()`

The `json.dumps()` method converts a Python object into a JSON string.

```python
data = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
json_string = json.dumps(data)
```

Now that weâ€™re JSON ninjas, letâ€™s put these methods to use by building a Hotel Accounting System!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

First, letâ€™s create a basic structure for our Hotel Accounting System. Weâ€™ll need:

1. A JSON file to store hotel data (bookings, customer info, etc.).
2. Python functions to manage this data.

Create a file called `hotel_data.json`, and initialize it with an empty dictionary:

```json
{}
```

## Step 2: Defining the Hotel Accounting System Functions

Letâ€™s define some basic functions to handle bookings, checkouts, and displaying customer info.

### 1. Adding a Booking

Letâ€™s create a function called `add_booking()` that takes customer details and booking info, and then saves it to the JSON file.

```python
import json

def add_booking(customer_name, room_number, nights, rate_per_night):
    try:
        with open('hotel_data.json', 'r') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        data = {}

    # Calculate total charges
    total_charge = nights * rate_per_night

    # Create a booking dictionary
    booking = {
        "customer_name": customer_name,
        "room_number": room_number,
        "nights": nights,
        "rate_per_night": rate_per_night,
        "total_charge": total_charge
    }

    # Store booking data
    data[customer_name] = booking

    # Save data back to JSON file
    with open('hotel_data.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
    
    print(f"Booking added for {customer_name} in room {room_number}.")

# Example usage
add_booking(customer_name="John Doe",room_number= 101,nights= 3,rate_per_night= 100)
```

### 2. Displaying Bookings

Next, letâ€™s create a function called `view_bookings()` to display all bookings.

```python
def view_bookings():
    try:
        with open('hotel_data.json', 'r') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        data = {}
    
    if not data:
        print("No bookings found.")
        return
    
    for customer, details in data.items():
        print(f"Customer: {customer}")
        for key, value in details.items():
            print(f"  {key}: {value}")
        print()  # Newline for readability

# Example usage
view_bookings()
```

### 3. Checking Out a Customer

Now, letâ€™s create a `checkout()` function that removes a customerâ€™s booking from the JSON file.

```python
def checkout(customer_name):
    try:
        with open('hotel_data.json', 'r') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No bookings found.")
        return

    if customer_name in data:
        del data[customer_name]
        with open('hotel_data.json', 'w') as file:
            json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
        print(f"Checked out {customer_name}.")
    else:
        print(f"No booking found for {customer_name}.")

# Example usage
checkout("John Doe")
```

### 4. Calculating Total Revenue

Finally, letâ€™s create a `calculate_revenue()` function to sum up the charges from all bookings.

```python
def calculate_revenue():
    try:
        with open('hotel_data.json', 'r') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        data = {}

    total_revenue = sum(booking["total_charge"] for booking in data.values())
    print(f"Total Revenue: ${total_revenue}")

# Example usage
calculate_revenue()
```

## Wrapping Up
Absolutely! Wrapping all functions in a `while` loop will make our Hotel Accounting System interactive, allowing users to choose options in a menu-like format and perform various operations repeatedly until they choose to exit. Letâ€™s go ahead and implement this.

### Step 3: Adding a Main Menu Loop

Here, weâ€™ll create a function called `main_menu()` that will:

1. Display a menu with available options.
2. Take user input to determine which action to perform.
3. Continue looping until the user chooses to exit.

```python
def main_menu():
    while True:
        print("\n--- Hotel Accounting System ---")
        print("1. Add Booking")
        print("2. View Bookings")
        print("3. Checkout Customer")
        print("4. Calculate Revenue")
        print("5. Exit")
        
        # Get user choice
        choice = input("Choose an option (1-5): ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            customer_name = input("Enter customer name: ")
            room_number = int(input("Enter room number: "))
            nights = int(input("Enter number of nights: "))
            rate_per_night = float(input("Enter rate per night: "))
            add_booking(customer_name, room_number, nights, rate_per_night)
        
        elif choice == '2':
            view_bookings()
        
        elif choice == '3':
            customer_name = input("Enter customer name for checkout: ")
            checkout(customer_name)
        
        elif choice == '4':
            calculate_revenue()
        
        elif choice == '5':
            print("Exiting the system. Have a great day!")
            break
        
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number from 1 to 5.")
```

### Explanation of the `main_menu()` Function

1. **Display Menu Options**: The function starts by printing a menu with options for the user. Each option corresponds to a specific function in the system: adding bookings, viewing bookings, checking out a customer, calculating revenue, and exiting the program.

2. **Get User Input**: The `input()` function is used to capture the user's choice. We then use an `if-elif` block to determine which action to perform based on the user's input.

3. **Execute Functions Based on User Choice**:
   - **If `1` is chosen**, it prompts for booking details and calls the `add_booking()` function.
   - **If `2` is chosen**, it calls `view_bookings()` to display all current bookings.
   - **If `3` is chosen**, it asks for the customerâ€™s name and calls `checkout()` to remove their booking.
   - **If `4` is chosen**, it calls `calculate_revenue()` to display the total revenue from all bookings.
   - **If `5` is chosen**, the loop is broken with the `break` statement, and a farewell message is displayed.

4. **Invalid Input Handling**: If the user enters anything other than `1-5`, it displays an error message and the loop continues, allowing the user to choose a valid option.

### Running the Program

Now, you can simply call the `main_menu()` function to start the interactive Hotel Accounting System:

```python
main_menu()
```

When you run the program, youâ€™ll see a menu. You can then enter the corresponding number for the action you want to take, and the system will respond accordingly. You can keep performing actions until you select option `5` to exit.

And there you have it! ðŸŽ‰ You now have a fully interactive Hotel Accounting System using JSON as a small database. This loop provides a simple but effective way to simulate a real system, making it easy to extend with additional features in the future. Happy coding!
